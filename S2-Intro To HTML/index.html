        The Pomeranian is a breed of dog of the Spitz type that is named for the Pomerania region in north-west Poland and north-east Germany in Central Europe. Classed as a toy dog breed because of its small size, the Pomeranian is descended from larger Spitz-type dogs, specifically the German Spitz
        As mentioned, Pomeranians originated in the province of Pomerania, which is a region of Northern Europe on the coast of the Baltic Sea. They can trace their roots back to large sled dogs and are close relatives to breeds such as the American Eskimo Dog, Alaskan Malamute, Siberian Husky, Norwegian Elkhound, and Samoyed. The first Pomeranians could weigh between 20 to 30 pounds.Queen Victoria of England is responsible for the small size of these dogs today. She brought one home from a vacation in Florence, Italy and went to work breeding them to become a little lapdog. Queen Victoria isnâ€™t the only famous person to fall for this breed. Sir Isaac Newton, Martin Luther, Michelangelo, and Mozart all had Pom Poms.
